# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included content.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
- **Formatting**: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.

# Project Governance

**This is an [OPEN Source Project](http://openopensource.org/).**

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit access to the project to contribute as they
see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground rules for collaborators:

1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
2. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull request** to solicit
   feedback from other contributors.
3. Internal pull requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the
   discretion of the contributor.
4. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.
